# LibC-STL: A C Implementation of Standard Template Library (STL)

## Overview

C-STL is a project aimed at implementing a subset of the functionality provided by the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) in pure C. The motivation behind this project stems from the efficiency and versatility of the C++ STL, which has been widely acclaimed as one of the most efficient code libraries in C++. This projects aims at implementing C++ STL in C as efficient and as easy to use as possible.

## Motivation
The C++ STL is renowned for its rich collection of data structures, algorithms, and utilities, which simplify and streamline the process of software development in C++. Recognizing the value and efficiency of the STL, this project seeks to bridge this gap by bringing some of the essential features of the STL to the C programming language.

## Project Goals
- Implement core data structures such as vectors, linked lists, stacks, queues, maps, and sets in C.
- Develop efficient algorithms for common operations like sorting, searching, and manipulation of data structures.
- Provide a user-friendly interface and intuitive API for easy integration into C projects.
- Ensure compatibility and portability across different platforms and compilers.
- Foster a community of contributors and users to collaborate on further enhancements and improvements.

## Key Features
- **Vector**: Resizable arrays similar to vectors in C++. [Example](#example)
- **Iterators**: C++ style iterators to iterate containers efficiently.
- **Linked List**: Singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists. [to be implemened]
- **Stacks and Queues**: Implementations using arrays or linked lists. [to be implemened]
- **Maps and Sets**: Hash maps or binary search trees for key-value pairs and unique elements. [to be implemened]
- **String Manipulation**: Functions for manipulating strings, including concatenation, substring extraction, and searching. [to be implemened]
- **Algorithms**: Common algorithms for sorting, searching, and manipulation of sequences. [to be implemened]
- **Error Handling**: Mechanisms for error handling and exception management. [to be implemened]

### Note from maintainer
This project serves as a learning endeavor for me to explore dynamic memory management in C, gaining insights into the STL in C++, and honing skills in library design and DSA. I'm eager to see this project flourish and evolve further.

## Example
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "./include/Vector.h"

typedef struct mystruct
{
    int data;
    char *name;
} MyStruct;

int main()
{
    Vector *int_vec = vector_create(sizeof(int));

    int values[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
    {
        vector_push_back(int_vec, &values[i]);
    }

    printf("Integer Vector:\n");
    for (size_t i = 0; i < vector_size(int_vec); i++)
    {
        printf("%d ", *(int *)vector_at(int_vec, i));
    }
    printf("\n");

    vector_destroy(int_vec);

    Vector *double_vec = vector_create(sizeof(double));

    double dvalues[] = {1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4};
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++)
    {
        vector_push_back(double_vec, &dvalues[i]);
    }

    printf("Double Vector:\n");
    for (size_t i = 0; i < vector_size(double_vec); i++)
    {
        printf("%.1f ", *(double *)vector_at(double_vec, i));
    }
    printf("\n");

    vector_destroy(double_vec);
    MyStruct v1 = {10, "Jasper"};
    MyStruct v2 = {20, "Kasper"};
    MyStruct v3 = {30, "Hasper"};
    MyStruct v4 = {40, "Gasper"};

    Vector *custom_vec = vector_create(sizeof(MyStruct));
    vector_push_back(custom_vec, &v1);
    vector_push_back(custom_vec, &v2);
    vector_push_back(custom_vec, &v3);
    vector_push_back(custom_vec, &v4);
     
    for(size_t i = 0; i < vector_size(custom_vec); i++){
        MyStruct *item = (MyStruct*)vector_at(custom_vec, i);
        printf("%d %s\n", item->data, item->name);
    }

    return 0;
}
